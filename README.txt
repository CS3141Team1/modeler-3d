How To Use Modeler3d

Pre-requisites:

MUST HAVE Boost libraries compiled and linked.
MUST HAVE SDL2 compiled and linked.
MUST HAVE GLEW compiled and linked.

Primary support is for MinGW but it may work on Cygwin or VisualC++.

We now have support for buttons! When you run Modeler3D.exe you will see 
four buttons at the top left and four buttons at the top right.

Top Left, going down: Loads bunny.obj, loads cube.obj, loads dragon.obj, loads pencil.obj

Top right, going down: Quick zoom to Z = 1, Z = 100, Z = 1000, Z = 2500 (useful for massive models)

You can also use the scroll wheel to zoom.

Soon it will have support for loading your own .obj files!
